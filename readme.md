##Back-end Developer Exercise

* Used Laravel framework as it saves time due to the pre-built classes
* The code in this repository is for "PingMe!" a basic social network
* Visitors can signup and login to the network or view all messages
* Users can send messages and reply to other users (Unique, single word messages but not to themselves)
* Users can view all messages or view only sent or received messages
* Pagination has been used so users and viewers can only see 20 messages per page
* Users can also see conversations they had with other users

* Apologies the whole task took more than allocated time and have used several sources online for some details.
* There are few errors that I could have corrected but due to limitation of time, couldnt carry out
